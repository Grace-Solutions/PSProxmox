    # Display network interfaces from guest agent
    foreach ($interface in $vm.GuestAgent.NetIf) {
        Write-Host "Interface: $($interface.Name)"
        Write-Host "  IPv4 Addresses: $($interface.IPv4Addresses -join ', ')"

    }
} else {
    Write-Host "Guest Agent not available or not running"
