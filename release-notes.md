# PSProxmox v2025.05.30.2323 Release Notes

## Major Improvements

### ‚ö° Performance Optimization
- **Added `-IncludeGuestAgent` parameter** to Get-ProxmoxVM cmdlet for optional guest agent data retrieval
- **Significant performance improvement** for normal VM queries (guest agent data no longer fetched by default)
- **Flexible querying**: Choose between fast queries or detailed guest agent information as needed
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing scripts work unchanged but run faster

### üéâ VM Guest Agent Support
- **Enhanced Get-ProxmoxVM cmdlet** with comprehensive guest agent data retrieval (when requested)
- **New ProxmoxVMGuestAgent model** with detailed network interface information
- **IPv4 and IPv6 address arrays** for each network interface detected by guest agent
- **Guest agent status checking** with robust error handling for VMs without guest agent
- **Complete VM network visibility** from within the guest operating system

### üîß Complete Codebase Stabilization
- **Fixed ALL 41 compilation errors** (100% success rate) that were present in the codebase
- **Eliminated ALL compilation warnings** for completely clean builds
- **Standardized API patterns** across all cmdlets for consistency and reliability
- **Enhanced type safety** throughout the entire codebase
- **Modern C# best practices** applied consistently
- **Clean binary module structure** with proper packaging

### üöÄ Enhanced Reliability
- **Robust error handling** for guest agent operations
- **Improved API client usage** with proper parameter handling
- **Better JSON processing** with strongly-typed objects instead of dynamic types
- **Consistent parameter validation** across all cmdlets

## Usage Examples

### ‚ö° Performance Optimization Examples
```powershell
# Connect to Proxmox
Connect-ProxmoxServer -Server "proxmox.example.com" -Credential (Get-Credential)

# Fast queries (default behavior - NEW!)
$vms = Get-ProxmoxVM                    # Fast - no guest agent data
$vm = Get-ProxmoxVM -VMID 100          # Fast - no guest agent data

# Detailed queries (when you need guest agent info)
$vm = Get-ProxmoxVM -VMID 100 -IncludeGuestAgent    # Detailed - with guest agent

# Performance comparison
Measure-Command { $fast = Get-ProxmoxVM }                          # Fast
Measure-Command { $detailed = Get-ProxmoxVM -IncludeGuestAgent }   # Slower but detailed
```

### üîç VM Guest Agent Information
```powershell
# Get VM with guest agent information (use -IncludeGuestAgent)
$vm = Get-ProxmoxVM -VMID 100 -IncludeGuestAgent

# Access guest agent data
if ($vm.GuestAgent -and $vm.GuestAgent.Status -eq "running") {
    Write-Host "Guest Agent is running"

    # Display network interfaces from guest agent
    foreach ($interface in $vm.GuestAgent.NetIf) {
        Write-Host "Interface: $($interface.Name)"
        Write-Host "  IPv4 Addresses: $($interface.IPv4Addresses -join ', ')"
        Write-Host "  IPv6 Addresses: $($interface.IPv6Addresses -join ', ')"
        Write-Host "  MAC Address: $($interface.MacAddress)"
    }
} else {
    Write-Host "Guest Agent not available or not running"
}

# Get all VMs with guest agent information
$vmsWithGuestAgent = Get-ProxmoxVM -IncludeGuestAgent | Where-Object {
    $_.GuestAgent -and $_.GuestAgent.Status -eq "running"
}
```

### üîß Clean Build and Development
```powershell
# The module now builds completely clean with no errors or warnings
dotnet build PSProxmox\PSProxmox.csproj
# Build succeeded with 0 error(s) and 0 warning(s)
